=====================
About The Development
=====================

This Augmented Reality with English-Chinese Annotations (ARE) Android app is based on `the Google TensorFlow Lite demo app <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.5/tensorflow/contrib/lite>`_.

The original demo app infers a pretrained neural network model to recognize objects from images from smartphone camera, and annotate on the screen with the most probable 3 labels (English texts).

In the ARE app, the English lables (labels.txt) are offline translated to Chinese (labelsZhTw.txt). During recognization, the most 3 probable labels of English and the corresponding Chinese labels are annotated. This is the main contribution of this app.

=========================
The Usage of ARE App
=========================

One usage of the ARE app is for Chinese people to learn English from reality objects, which are practical things to be learnt, aren't them?

=========================
